Navigation
==========

To access files in other directories, we need to be able to navigate our filesystem. Once again, below is our filesystem we will use as an example.

![Example Filesystem](/img/bash-filesystem.png)

We are currently in the 'DevKey' folder, AKA the 'root' folder.

### Commands you will learn

1.  **ls** : List stuff
2.  **cd** : Change directory
3.  **pwd** : Print Working Directory

### LS

'ls' is used to list what _stuff_ is in your current directory. We use it like this:

`ls`

So, when running that, we get:

`Apps Documents Photos`

We know that because the first things that are inside the DevKey folder are:

`Apps Documents Photos`

There we go! We managed to do something in the terminal!

We can add a _flag_ to our command to change the output. We can add '-a' to the end. Like so:

`ls -a`

When running this, we get:

`. .. .DS_Store Apps Documents Photos`

This will show all the files in your current directory, but including hidden files, which always start with a '.'

The '.' in the result of the command represents the current directory, and the '..' represents the previous directory.

That'll be the only flag you'll need to know for now.

  

### CD

'cd' stands for Change Directory, guess what we use it for, changing directories!

We know that the subdirectories in our current directory, are:

`Apps Documents Photos`

Let's move to the Documents subdirectory.

`cd Documents`

When we run that, we'll automatically move to the Documents folder.

If we want to move _back_ a directory, we can run:

`cd ..`

If we want to move to the _root_ folder, we can run:

`cd /`  

### PWD

'pwd' is a usefull command that you might need from time to time. It stands for Print Working Directory. When we run it, it will tell us where we are in our filesystem!

`pwd`

That will return:

`/DevKey/Documents`

Now we know where we are!

  

### OPTIMISATION

If we want to know what is in a subdirectory, but we're not bothered to move into that folder, run ls, then move out of it, we can just run:

`ls [folder name]`

Just replace the \[folder name\] with the name of the folder you want to look inside
