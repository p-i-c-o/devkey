Files
=====

We are back in the 'DevKey' folder, AKA the 'root' folder.

### Commands you will learn

1.  **mkdir** : Make a directory
2.  **touch** : Create a file
3.  **nano** : Edit a file

### MKDIR

'mkdir' is a command that creates a folder where you currently are. We use it by typing 'mkdir' and the name you want to give the folder! Let's create a folder called 'Test Folder'

`mkdir Test Folder`

Everything seems in order when we run this, but we accidentally made 2 seperate folders. We made a folder called 'Test' and 'Folder'. Let's try again:

`mkdir 'Test Folder'`

Above is the proper method to make a folder with spaces in it's name. There is another method, but it isn't as easy:

`mkdir Test\ Folder/`

I don't reccoment the above method because it requires you to add a backslash every time, but the quotation

### TOUCH

Even with its odd name, this command is one of the most usefull commands for quickly creating empty files. Let's say we want to create a file called 'message.txt', we would do it like this:

`touch message.txt`

That's it, really!

A usefull flag that could prevent mistakes is '-c', it makes sure that when you are creating the file, it won't overwrite another file named exactly the same. Useful!
