FUNCTIONS
=========

Functions help you use code many times over. Instead of having to copy paste code, you can create ****functions**** to create a single command, that runs a predefined set of code. We define them like so:

    def <funtionname>(<args>):
     <action>
    

Let’s say we want to create a function that takes 2 strings and puts them together, we could do this:

    def stringadd(str1, str2):
     output = str1 + str2
     return(output)
    

So when we would run this, like so:

    stringadd('Hello, ','World!')
    

We would not get any output, because the `return` command just returns a variable. If we want to print it, we would have to do:

    print(stringadd('Hello, ','World!'))
    

When you call a function, make sure to input the exact same number of variables into the argument field as when you defined the function.

    def thingy(var1):
     return var
    thingy('Hello!') # Returns normally
    thingy('Hello!', 'unnecessary variable') # Returns an error
    

### Variable arguments

Let’s say we want to have a function accept multiple variables that prints them each out, we would use:

    def thingy(*args):
     for i in args:
     print(i)
    

This would accept as many variables as you give it and save it to the `args` variable as a list.

We could also use `kwargs` , that works exactly the same, but calling the function would run differently, like so:

    thingy('Hello', 'World!') # Regular variables
    thingy(str1='Hello', str2='World!') # Keyword Variables
    

`kwargs` stands for Keyword Arguments, whereas `args` just stands for Arguments.
