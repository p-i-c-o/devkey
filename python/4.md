CONTROL FLOW
============

We have previously talked about operators, which return either `True` or `False` , this is rarely used alone.

We use if statement to make decisions in Python, like so:

    if <condition>:
     <action>
    

The `<condition>` can either be `True` or `False` , we could simply do:

    if True:
     <action>
    

But that would make it happen every single time, we only want it to happen when it needs to. Let’s create a simple password checker, like so:

    pswd = input("What's the secret password? ") # Asks for a password
    if pswd == "s3cr3t":                         # Checks if pswd is equal to 's3cr3t'
     print("That's right!")
    

In the `<condition>` field we can add any comparison (refer to the Operators guide)

We can always use a simple `if` statement, but it’s quite bleak. We can bring this up a notch by using the `else` statement, here’s how we could use it in the password checker script:

    pswd = input("What's the secret password? ") # Asks for a password
    if pswd == "s3cr3t":                         # Checks if pswd is equal to 's3cr3t'
     print("That's right!")
    else:                                        # This runs when the "if" statement is false
     print('Nope, wrong!')
    

There also is `elif` , here’s an easy way of understanding it.

`if` : Highest priority, always runs first.

`elif` : Second priority, run second only if `if` returns `False` .

`else` : Third priority, runs only when everything else returns `False` .

So let’s say in our password checker, there is a secret secret password, one that’ll give us access to everything. We could use `elif` like so:

    pswd = input("What's the secret password? ") # Asks for a password
    if pswd == "s3cr3t":                         # Checks if pswd is equal to 's3cr3t'
     print("That's right!")
    elif pswd == "s3cr3ts3cr3tpassword":         # Checks only if the 'if' statment is wrong.
     print('Ooh, you found the Super secret password! Nice!')
    else:                                        # This runs when the "if" statement is false
     print('Nope, wrong!')
    

If we used a `if` statement in both checks, the Python interpreter would check the password for `s3cr3t` , and then `s3cr3ts3cr3tpassword` , but by using elif, the interpreter would only check for `s3cr3ts3cr3tpassword` if the first check resulted falsely.
