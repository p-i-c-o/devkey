Input / Output
==============

Input and Output is an essential part of Python, as it gives your code the ability to change according to your data.

Input
-----

The basic way to ask for input in Python is using  `input()` . When running this, it will give you the ability to enter text, untill you press the enter key.

A nice feature to this function, is if you add a string (i.e. a piece of text in between quotation marks), it will show that text right before the empty space for your input!

Let's test this out:

    python -c 'input("Hello, World!")'
    

When running this, we get this:

    Hello, World!
    

Right after that peice of text, we can type whatever we want!

Output
------

When using a piece of software, the whole point is to get an output, so we can understand information, no? Well, it's strikingly simple with python.

To output any variable type, we can just use this command:

    print()
    

When running this by itself, it does nothing. But when we give it a variable to work with ( a variable with data inside it, of course ), it will display the contents of that variable. Like this:

    print("Hi, I'm a Variable!")
    

Guess what happens when we run that?

    Hi, I'm a Variable!
    

Nice! It did what we asked for!

Below is a list of results from when you use different data types with the 'print()' function

*   String  _out: Hello_
*   Integer  _out: 12_
*   Float  _out: 65.2_
*   Boolean  _out: True_
*   List  _out: ('one', 'two', 'three')_
