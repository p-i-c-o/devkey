EXCEPTION HANDLING
==================

We all run into errors when coding, so here you’ll learn how to handle them in a way that doesn’t crash your code.

If we expect an error to occur we can simply just tell the Python interpreter to try something, like so:

    try:
      # Code to try
    except:
      # Run when an error occurs

Let’s create a very simple code with this outline that we know will return an error:

    try:
      print(NonExistantVariable)
    except:
      print('An error occured')

When we run this we get: `An error occured`

This is purely because we haven’t defined the `NonExistantVariable` variable. If we had run this code simply like this:

    print(NonExistantVariable)

We would get:

    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "<string>", line 1, in <module>
    NameError: name 'NonExistantVariable' is not defined

Another cool trick with this, we can add a specific argument to the `except` statement. Like so:

    try:
      print(NonExistantVariable)
    except NameError:
      print('An error occured')

This will only run that code if it receives a `NameError` error, otherwise, it’ll just give us the regular error message. Having an `except` statement set up to catch errors will handle them then move on in the script, whereas not having them will cause the error to stop the script all together.

Ok, so now we understand the basics. Let’s move on to the `else` statement. Similarly to the standard if/else statements, we can add an `else` statement to an `except` statement.

    try:
      print(NonExistantVariable)
    except:
      print('An error occured')
    else:
      print("This will run when the except statement doesn't run")

As mentioned in the code, the `else` statement only runs when the except statement doesn’t run.

Finally, we can use the `finally` statement to end it all, this will run at the end of the whole code block, and it is always executed.

    try:
      print(NonExistantVariable)
    except:
      print('An error occured')
    else:
      print("This will run when the except statement doesn't run")
    finally:
      print('This will always run')

All done! Now you know how to handle exceptions.
